SlidingMenu-Android
===================

Sliding Menu using Android drawer adapted to be used on versions earlier than Api 11 (min Api level is 7), the initial code is from this tutorial that works on api level 11 and above : http://www.androidhive.info/2013/11/android-sliding-menu-using-navigation-drawer/

To use this code you need to add the reference to Android support library v4 and v7, here's how to do it : http://developer.android.com/tools/support-library/setup.html 

To highlight the menu items when selected this code source was used: https://github.com/theomega/ActivatedStateDemo (the original code from Ravi Tamada works only on Api level 14 and above)
